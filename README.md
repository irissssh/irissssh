## IT-BA-3107


## DESCRIPTION
  The main objective of this project is to develop a Hotel Reservation System that enhances operational efficiency, improves the guest experience, and boosts revenue by effectively managing bookings, room allocation, and customer data. This project falls under 11th SDG because of sustaining the development improvement in the lives of people. It also defines capacity-building as all relevant issues to sustainable urban development.<b>
  
- Effortlessly navigate to select available rooms, choose dates, view room prices, complete secure transactions through various payment methods, and receive notifications via email or SMS for a comprehensive and user-friendly booking experience.<br>
- Create a secure reservation management interface that allows users to change and track bookings.<br>


## Project Overview
Legend's Hotel, established in 2021 in Lemery Batangas, initially faced system errors in
their reservation setup, leading to conflicting schedules for customers. After identifying
these issues, developers upgraded their system, utilizing better programming languages
to analyze customer data and prevent conflicting bookings. With this improvement, The reservation system now runs seamlessly. The hotel boasts nine rooms, including King Family Suites, Queen Deluxe, Family Suite, and VIP Queen Suite, all equipped with modern amenities. To streamline services and enhance customer experience, the developers collaborated with administrators to create an updated reservation system, aiming to reduce time consumption, ensure payment accuracy, and facilitate efficient room bookings online.<br>

## Technology Used
- GUI: Canva - Before even starting the project, we designed the User Interface of the system using Canva. This design served as the foundation for the final front-end design of the system.<br>
- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript - Before creating the styling of the system, we first established all the HTML files of the system. We did this to establish a foundation in order to streamline the development of the front-end design using CSS. There are some buttons that are needed for interactive purposes, such as popup sections of the system, and for those we used JavaScript Event Listeners.<br>
- Back-end: PHP, MySQL, Xampp - In order for the system to function and communicate with the database, we used Xampp and PHP. Xampp was used as a tool for the back-end developer to access the database needed for the project. PHP on the other hand, was used to do SQL Queries in order to allow the system to achieve its functional requirements.<br>

## GUI Design:
- **Canva**: Used for designing the initial User Interface (UI) of the system.

### Front-end:
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Established HTML files to lay the foundation for front-end design using CSS. Employed JavaScript for interactive buttons and popup sections.

### Back-end:
- **PHP, MySQL, Xampp**: Utilized Xampp and PHP to facilitate communication between the system and the database. Xampp served as the tool to access the database, while PHP executed SQL queries for functional requirements.
